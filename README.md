## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of our analysis was to provide W. Avy with the temperatures in Oahu, HI for the months of June and December. This information is needed to determine whether or not our new business idea, a surf and ice cream shop hybrid, will be successful year round.

## Results
- The average temperature in Oahu in the month of June is 74.9° F, which is quite a seasonable temperature for surfing and ice cream. The lowest temperature in Oahu in June was 64.0° F, and the highest was 85.0° F. The data tells us that June should shape up to be a successful month for our business venture.

- The average temperature in Oahu in the month of December is 71.0° F. This is slightly lower than June's average temperature, but still very comfortable, and ideal for surfing and ice cream. The lowest temperature in Oahu in December was 56.0° F, and the highest was 83.0° F. 56.0° F is a little chilly for surfing and ice cream, but the average and highest temperatures for December still seem promising.

- In comparing the data from both months, we can see that there isn't a huge difference in the average or maximum temperatures between June and December in Oahu. The only slightly concerning data point is the low temperature for December of 56.0° F, but even so, that chilly of a temperature does not appear to be extremely common based on the average temperature of 71.0° F.

## Summary

While June is certainly a more ideal month for a surfing and ice cream shop to see an influx of customers, December really isn't that different temperature-wise. The data tells us that it is entirely possible to sustain a surfing and ice cream shop hybrid year round. Also, we know that Oahu sees its fair share of tourists year round. These tourists will likely seek out opportunities to go surfing during their vacations, and what's better than learning how to surf while enjoying an ice cream cone?

As far as alternate queries that we could run to seek more information about our data and how it could affect our business, we could run a query to see which month shows the highest amount of precipitation, and which month shows the lowest. It would certainly be helpful to know which months are affected by inclement weather, as this would likely result in a decrease in business. We could even run a query to discover the warmest week of the year, as this could indicate a possible spike in business. Nothing is better than delicious ice cream and the inviting, blue ocean to cool you down on a hot day!
